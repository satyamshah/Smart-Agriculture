# Smart-Farming
 Smart farming is an emerging concept, because IoT sensors capable of providing information about their agriculture fields. The project aims making use of evolving technology i.e. IoT and smart agriculture using automation. Monitoring environmental factors is the major factor to improve the yield of the efficient crops. The feature of this project includes monitoring temperature, humidity and moisture in agricultural field through sensors DHT11, YL69. It will turn ON/OFF motor on the basis of soil moisture.
